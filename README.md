# numerical_methods_python
Numerical approximations to undergraduate numerical analysis topics in Physics, mathematics and corporate finance.

These are methods I picked up through my mathematics major and physics concentration, in the context of deriving solutions through programming.
I am incredibly thankful to Professors Katherine Ott, Jeffery Oishi and Nathan Tefft.
